# Electron Microscopy Training

📖 **[View the Documentation](https://bobleesj.github.io/electron-microscopy/)**

Step-by-step tutorials focused on practice sitting in front of the microscope with a focus on visual elements.

## For contributors

### Writing conventions and principles

Writing guides for humans and quality control:

- We want to make correct decisions with the least cognitive overload for the reader.
- We want to serve "IKEA manual" of microscopes.
- The adage "A picture is worth a thousand words" should be judiciously applied. Balance richness vs. cognitive overload.

Formatting consistency:

- Use sub-bullets (`-`) for details under each step
- No periods for action commands (e.g., `Click Col Valves Open on TEMUI`)
- Use periods for observations/explanations (e.g., `Notice the image is pulsing in and out.`)
- Lowercase for general text, uppercase only for acronyms:
  - Uppercase: TEM, STEM, 4D-STEM, EELS, EDS, HAADF, ABF, BF, FFT, FOV
  - Uppercase: TEMUI, Velox (software names)
  - Uppercase: A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, C3, S3 (aberration parameters)
  - Lowercase: beam, aperture, intensity, magnification, etc.
- Place images after relevant steps with `alt` text and `width="500"`
- Use `<img src="..." alt="..." width="500">` for all images
- Use `.jpg` format for images (not `.png`)
- Keep TODO items at the top of each document (e.g., `> TODO: ...`)
- Keep a `## Changelog` section at the bottom with dated entries
- Use `STEM.md` as the main reference document for formatting

### Checklist before submitting

- [ ] Is our writing the clearest yet most concise for decision-making for complete beginners?
- [ ] Have we added a concise changelog entry?
- [ ] Did you run `python scripts/process_new_images.py --max-width 1200 --delete-originals` for new images?

### Local development

```bash
# Install mdBook

# macOS
brew install mdbook
# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install mdbook
# Windows (with Scoop)
scoop install mdbook
# Any OS (with Cargo/Rust)
cargo install mdbook
```bash

```bash
# Run local dev server
mdbook serve --open
```

### Process new images

```bash
pip install Pillow pillow-heif
python scripts/process_new_images.py --max-width 1200 --delete-originals
```

### File structure

```
