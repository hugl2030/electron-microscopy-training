# Electron Microscopy Training (WIP)

WIP:

- [ ] Use real screenshots instead of pictures
- [ ] Better pictures: proportion, focus, FOV
- [ ] More visuals added to each session when needed

Disclaimer: Always follow https://barnum.su.domains/ for correctness. Only use
this documentation if you are working with the authors of the document and you
are looking for quick visual references.

The content is meant to be used as a step-by-step tutorial focused on practice
sitting in front of the microscope with a focus on visual elements.

## How to load sample

> Disclaimer: This guide is written for those who have already used single-tilt
> and double-tilt before. If you are using this documentation for the first
> time, you should work with a supervisor.

### Single-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

> FIXME: use technical terms for these objects... "pin" or "clip"?

1. Push the pin inside the tiny hole shown below:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/single-tilt/01-holder-overview.jpg" alt="Single-tilt holder overview" width="500">

3. Lift the clip gently:

5. If using a copper grid, pinch the tip of the copper grid

6. Place the sample, shiny side up for the standard sample

### Double-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

1. Load the sample and washer (gold donut):

   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/01-holder-preparation.jpg" alt="Holder preparation" width="500">

2. Add the cap and rotate the holder about the long axis to ensure the sample is
   secure:

**Unload sample:**

1. Press down the very small hole gently as shown below:
   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/03-holder-locked.jpg" alt="Holder locked" width="500">

2. The three parts should all be disassembled and placed on the bottom:

## How to remove and insert holder

**Insert holder**

- Push the holder in, feel resistance. This will start the turbo pump immediately.
   <img src="img/sample-loading/holder-insert/01-holder-insertion.jpg" alt="Holder insertion to microscope" width="500">

- Wait 2 minutes, turn counter-clockwise.
- Guide the holder to push in. Expect the holder wants to move in. 
- On TEMUI, turn off turbo pump.

**Remove holder**

- Press `Reset holder` in TEMUI.
- Close column valves in TEMUI.
- Pull the holder straight out up to the point shown above, turn clockwise, pull the rest out continuously.

## For maintainers and authors

### Checklist for the human

- [ ] Is our writing the most clear, yet concise for making decision?
- [ ] Added concise changelog for each document? Ex) `Dec 13, 2025 - add 4D-STEM tutorial draft by @bobleesj`
- [ ] New images added? Did you run `python scripts/compress_images.py img/`

### Writing conventions

For consistency, use the following style (feed to LLM)

- Use `##` for main sections, `###` for numbered steps
- Use sub-bullets (`-`) for details under each step
- Use `<details>` and `<summary>` for collapsible FAQs
- Place images after relevant steps with `alt` text and `width="500"`
- Use `.jpg` format for images (not `.png`)
- Do not use horizontal lines (`---`)
- Keep TODO items at the top of each document (e.g., `> TODO: ...`)
- Keep a `## Changelog` section at the bottom with dated entries

### Scripts

#### Convert HEIC to JPG

Convert HEIC images (from iPhone) to compressed JPG:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install Pillow pillow-heif

# Convert all HEIC files in images/ folder
python scripts/convert_heic_to_jpg.py

# Convert and delete original HEIC files
python scripts/convert_heic_to_jpg.py --delete-originals

# Convert with resizing and custom quality
python scripts/convert_heic_to_jpg.py --max-width 1600 --quality 80 --delete-originals
```

#### Image compression

Compress JPG images:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install Pillow

# Compress and resize images
python scripts/compress_images.py img/ --max-width 1600 --quality 80
```
