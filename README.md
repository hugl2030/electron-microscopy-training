## How to load sample

> Disclaimer: This guide is written for those who have already used single-tilt
> and double-tilt before. If you are using this documentation for the first
> time, you should work with a supervisor.

### Single-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

**Holder ready:**

### Double-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

1. Load the sample and washer (gold donut):

2. Add the cap and rotate the holder about the long axis to ensure the sample is
   secure:

**Upload sample**

## How to remove and insert holder

**Insert holder**

- Push the holder in, feel resistance. This will start the turbo pump immediately.
- Wait 2 minutes, turn counter-clockwise.
- Guide the holder to push in.
- On TEMUI, turn off turbo pump.

**Remove holder**

- Reset holder in TEMUI.
- Close column valves in TEMUI.
- Pull the holder straight out, turn clockwise, pull the rest out continuously.

## For maintainers and authors

### Checklist for the human

- [ ] Is our writing the most clear, yet concise for making decision?
- [ ] Added concise changelog for each document? Ex) `Dec 13, 2025 - add 4D-STEM tutorial draft by @bobleesj`
- [ ] New images added? Did you run `python scripts/compress_images.py img/`

### Writing conventions

For consistency, use the following style (feed to LLM)

- Use `##` for main sections, `###` for numbered steps
- Use sub-bullets (`-`) for details under each step
- Use `<details>` and `<summary>` for collapsible FAQs
- Place images after relevant steps with `alt` text and `width="500"`
- Use `.jpg` format for images (not `.png`)
- Do not use horizontal lines (`---`)
- Keep TODO items at the top of each document (e.g., `> TODO: ...`)
- Keep a `## Changelog` section at the bottom with dated entries

### Scripts

#### Image compression

Compress JPG images without losing quality:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install Pillow

# Compress all images in a folder
python scripts/compress_images.py img/

# Preview changes without modifying files
python scripts/compress_images.py img/ --dry-run

# Adjust quality (default: 85, lower = smaller file)
python scripts/compress_images.py img/ --quality 70

# Resize large images to max width
python scripts/compress_images.py img/ --max-width 1200
```
