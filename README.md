# Electron Microscopy Training (WIP)

WIP:

- [ ] Use real screenshots instead of pictures
- [ ] Better pictures: proportion, focus, FOV
- [ ] More visuals added to each session when needed

Disclaimer: Always follow https://barnum.su.domains/ for correctness. Only use
this documentation if you are working with the authors of the document and you
are looking for quick visual references.

The content is meant to be used as a step-by-step tutorial focused on practice
sitting in front of the microscope with a focus on visual elements.

## Immediate TODO:

- [ ] `README.md` - how to open/close TITAN holder box
- [ ] `STEM.md` - better probe correction process
- [ ] `4D-STEM.md` - use API to turn on/off 4D-STEM camera?

## How to load sample

> Disclaimer: This guide is written for those who have already used single-tilt
> and double-tilt before. If you are using this documentation for the first
> time, you should work with a supervisor.

### Single-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

> FIXME: use technical terms for these objects... "pin" or "clip"?

1. Push the pin inside the tiny hole shown below:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/single-tilt/01-holder-overview.jpg" alt="Single-tilt holder overview" width="500">

3. Lift the clip gently:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/single-tilt/02-sample-placement.jpg" alt="Sample placement" width="500">

5. If using a copper grid, pinch the tip of the copper grid

6. Place the sample, shiny side up for the standard sample

   <img src="img/sample-loading/single-tilt/04-holder-inserted.jpg" alt="Holder inserted" width="500">

### Double-tilt holder

**Load sample:**

1. Load the sample and washer (gold donut):

   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/01-holder-preparation.jpg" alt="Holder preparation" width="500">

2. Add the cap and rotate the holder about the long axis to ensure the sample is
   secure:

   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/02-holder-insertion.jpg" alt="Holder insertion" width="500">

**Unload sample:**

1. Press down the very small hole gently as shown below:
   <img src="img/sample-loading/double-tilt/03-holder-locked.jpg" alt="Holder locked" width="500">

2. The three parts should all be disassembled and placed on the bottom:

## How to remove and insert holder

**Insert holder**

- Push the holder in, feel resistance. This will start the turbo pump immediately.
   <img src="[def]" alt="Holder insertion to microscope" width="500">

- Wait 2 minutes, turn counter-clockwise.
- Guide the holder to push in. Expect the holder wants to move in. 
- On TEMUI, turn off turbo pump.

**Remove holder**

- Press `Reset holder` in TEMUI.
- Close column valves in TEMUI.
- Pull the holder straight out up to the point shown above, turn clockwise, pull the rest out continuously.

## For maintainers and authors

### Checklist

- [ ] Is our writing the most clear, yet concise for making decision for a complete beginner and for those who haven't used the instrument for months and years?
- [ ] Have we added concise changelog for each document? Ex) `Dec 13, 2025 - add 4D-STEM tutorial draft by @bobleesj`
- [ ] Did you run `python scripts/process_new_images.py --max-width 1200 --delete-originals` for new images added?

### Writing conventions and principles

Writing guides for humans and quality control:

- We want to make correct decisions with the least amount of cognitive overload for the reader.
- We want this guide to be "IKEA manual" of microscopes. 
- This guide should be also followed by someone with minimal supervision with for beginners.
- Use the least amount writing required yet deliver the intended, ambinguous results. The old "A picture worth thouands words" can be judiicously applied.

Formatting consistency designed for LLM:

- Use sub-bullets (`-`) for details under each step
- No periods for action commands (e.g., `Click Col Valves Open on TEMUI`)
- Use periods for observations/explanations (e.g., `Notice the image is pulsing in and out.`)
- Lowercase for general text, uppercase only for acronyms:
  - Uppercase: TEM, STEM, 4D-STEM, EELS, EDS, HAADF, ABF, BF, FFT, FOV, LLM
  - Uppercase: TEMUI, Velox (software names)
  - Uppercase: A1, A2, B2, C1, C2, C3, S3 (aberration parameters)
  - Lowercase: beam, aperture, intensity, magnification, etc.
- Place images after relevant steps with `alt` text and `width="500"`
- Place `<img>` with an intention when it is presented after a bullet point
- Use `.jpg` format for images (not `.png`)
- Do not use horizontal lines (`---`)
- Keep TODO items at the top of each document (e.g., `> TODO: ...`)
- Keep a `## Changelog` section at the bottom with dated entries
- Use `STEM.md` as the main reference document for formatting.

### Scripts

Process new images (HEIC/PNG → JPG, compress, normalize extensions):

```bash
pip install Pillow pillow-heif
python scripts/process_new_images.py --max-width 1200 --delete-originals
```

## Acknolwedmgents

Authors thank Dr. Pinaki Mukherjee for training @bobleesj and Guoliang Hu at Stanford SNSF. 

## Changelog
