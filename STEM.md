# STEM

This guide covers STEM alignment on the Spectra 300. The process has three parts: TEM alignment (column optics), STEM alignment (focused probe), and imaging your sample.

> **Prerequisite:** Complete the [Sample loading](README.md#sample-loading) procedure before starting.

## Part 1: Column optics alignment in TEM mode

Turn the turbo pump off if working with a standard sample. Go to TEM mode in Velox.

1. **Find beam**
   - Click `Col Valves Open` on `TEMUI`
   - Set C1 to 2000, C2 to 70, C3 to 1,000 µm

     <img src="img/STEM/aperture-condenser.jpg" alt="aperture condenser" width="500">

   - At 700x, locate the gold (dark) and carbon boundary

2. **Adjust eucentric height**
   - Increase magnification to ~7,500x
   - Press z-axis up or down on the hand panel
   - At eucentric height, the image shows minimal contrast when tilting

   - Click `Adjust` under `Center C2`, center beam with Multifunction X/Y
   - If beam is far off: lower intensity to shrink beam, use hand panel ball to move to center
   - Click `TEM` under `Beam Settings` to return to three-lens mode

4. **Fix monochromator** (skip if no jagged area visible)
   - Set magnification to ~5,700x
   - Go to `Mono` tab, use `Shift` with multifunction knobs to move the jagged area

5. **Fix condenser stigmation**
   - Go to `Direct Alignment` → `Beam Shift`
   - Center beam with Multifunction X/Y
   - Go to ~200kx magnification

     <img src="img/STEM/zoom-in.jpg" alt="zoom in" width="500">

   - Make beam baseball-size on fluorescent screen
   - If not concentric: `Stigmator` → `Condenser`, adjust with multifunction knobs

6. **Fix beam tilt**
   - Click `Beam tilt pp X/Y` under `Direct Alignment`
   - Adjust multifunction X/Y to minimize jiggle

7. **Fix rotation center**
   - Spread beam across entire fluorescent screen
   - Click `Rotation center` under `Direct Alignment`
   - Press `R1` to lift fluorescent screen
   - In Velox, click play to start imaging

## Part 3: Image your sample

1. **After probe correction**
    - If aberrations persist: `Stigmator` → `Probe A1`, adjust focus
    - Alternative: `Stigmator` → `Probe B2`, uncheck focus
    - Target resolution: D < 60 pm (spec is 50 pm)

2. **Find zone-axis**
   - `Quick` tab → `Sample Piezo`, fine-tune z-axis
    - Unblank beam
    - In Velox, drag the red dot to move probe position
    - `Quick` tab → `Smart Tilt` for automatic alpha/beta adjustment
    - After tilting, verify C1A1 is still good

## Part 4: End session

1. **Finish**
    - Close the column on TEMUI
    - Turn the turbo pump on
    - Follow unload procedure in [README.md](README.md#how-to-remove-and-insert-holder)

## Appendix

**Underfocus vs overfocus:**

<img src="img/STEM/underfocus.jpg" alt="Underfocus example showing dark cores with bright Fresnel fringes" width="500">

- Underfocus: dark cores with bright Fresnel fringes on edges
- Overfocus: bright cores with dark edge fringes

**Gray colors during correction:**

Go to Velox `Auto-tune` and increase signal until it touches the red and blue dotted lines.

## FAQs

- **Convergence angle:** `Beam Setting` → `Probe`, use Multifunction Y to adjust.

- **Tableau and C1A1:** Tableau shows aberrations visually. C1A1 corrects first-order aberrations (astigmatism and coma).

- **Underfocus direction:** Counterclockwise on hand panel, Z-axis down.

- **Eucentric height:** The z-position where tilting doesn't shift the sample. Defocus = 0.

- **Beam Shift vs hand panel ball:** Beam Shift stores the center position internally, so the beam stays centered when changing magnification.

- **Underfocus vs overfocus:** Underfocus: edges become white/bright Fresnel fringes. Overfocus: contrast inverts.

- **Monochromator:** Filters the electron beam to select a narrow energy range, improving energy resolution for EELS.

- **Scan often:** Tilt causes FOV to change, so rescan frequently.

- **Wobble at high mag:** Ensures no sample-induced aberration.

- **Verify zone axis:** Use CrystalMaker simulated diffraction and Kikuchi lines crossing in the center.

- **Major zone axis:** Thick bends tend to form.

- **Nanoparticle area for correction:** Focus on "size gradient" region between dark film and bulk. Better for aberration algorithms.

### Lens system

- **Objective lens (TEM vs STEM):** In STEM, it sits above the sample and focuses the probe to ~1 Å. In TEM, it sits below and forms the first magnified image.

- **Back focal plane:** The objective lens focuses electrons scattered at the same angle to the same point here (forming the diffraction pattern).

- **Spherical aberration (Cs):** Electrons through outer lens focus at different points than center electrons. Blurs image, limits resolution. Cs correctors fix this.

- **Chromatic aberration (Cc):** Electrons with different energies focus at different points. Monochromator reduces this.

- **Cs corrector:** Uses multipole lenses to cancel spherical aberration, enabling sub-angstrom resolution.

- **Three condenser lenses (C1, C2, C3):** C1 controls brightness, C2 controls beam size/convergence, C3 provides additional probe formation flexibility.

- **Intensity knob:** Adjusts C2 lens to move crossover point. Clockwise = more focused, brighter. Counterclockwise = spread out, dimmer.

- **C2 aperture:** Limits beam angle and blocks stray electrons. Must be centered on optical axis.

- **Crossover symmetry:** If elliptical instead of round, there's condenser astigmatism degrading probe shape.

- **Two-lens vs three-lens mode:** Two-lens (C1+C2) for parallel illumination. Three-lens (C1+C2+C3) for STEM probe control. Align C2 in two-lens mode because it's simpler.

- **Objective aperture:** Sits at back focal plane, selects which diffracted beams contribute to image. Smaller = more contrast, less resolution.

- **Projector lenses:** Magnify and project image plane (imaging) or back focal plane (diffraction) onto screen/camera.

- **Focus changes with magnification:** Different mag uses different lens settings, slightly shifting focal plane.

- **Astigmatism correction:** Use stigmator coils (X and Y) to make elliptical beam circular.

- **Convergence angle and resolution:** Larger angle = higher resolution but more aberrations. There's an optimal angle.

### STEM detectors

- **HAADF:** High-Angle Annular Dark Field. Collects high-angle scattered electrons, gives Z-contrast.

- **ABF:** Annular Bright Field. Collects low-angle, good for light elements.

- **BF:** Bright Field. Collects direct beam.

- **Z-contrast:** Scattering scales with Z² (atomic number squared). Heavier atoms appear brighter.

- **Ronchigram:** Shadow image of probe on detector when focused on amorphous area. Flat, featureless = good alignment.

### Beam sensitive samples

- **Beam sensitive region:** Still scan, but on a small window only to avoid damaging other areas.

- **Beam intensity for sensitive materials:** ~50 pA can cause beam damage.

- **Alternative approach:** Use lower keV, but requires hours for beam to stabilize.
